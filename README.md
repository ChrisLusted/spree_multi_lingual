SpreeMultiLingual
=================

SpreeMultiLingual.languages to an array containing the languages you support.

	SpreeMultiLingual.languages = ["fr", "en", "es"]
  
No fallback for now!


Inspired from [https://github.com/tomash/spree_globalize](https://github.com/tomash/spree_globalize) (even took some pieces of code! Especially the "globalize_accessors" method.)


Example
=======

Example goes here.

Testing
-------

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test app
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
